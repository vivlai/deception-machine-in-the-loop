## Machine in the Loop: A Case on Deception Detection

We used deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. For more details, our work is presented in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07901).

This repository contains the dataset of the empirical study we performed. `label.jsonlist.gz` contains users inputs and `survey.jsonlist.gz` contains users survey response and demographic information.
